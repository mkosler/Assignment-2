h3. Program Description

Assignment 2 deals mainly with the testing various sorting functions, specifically *selection sort*, *insertion sort*, *bubble sort*, *shell sort*, 
and *radix sort*. The user of the program is required to write in a few command line arguments that tell the program:

* which sorting algorithm to use;
* where to get its input source;
* where to insert the sorted output;

h3. Purpose of the Assignment

In addition to implementing various sorting algorithms, the assignment is trying to show us how different algorithms compare to one another directly. 
We are also supposed to see that the algorithms have much different run times based on the size of their input, which gives us a good visualization 
of how a run-time function (and asymptotic notation) works in a real world scenario.

h3. Data Structures Description

We are mainly sorting through arrays of integers, so nothing fancy there.
